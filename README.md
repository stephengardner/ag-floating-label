ag-floating-label
======================

Angular directive to create a floating label inspired by [Angular material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/input).

* None of the extra Angular Material fluff/bloat
* Simple directive support to add hints on focus
* Scss that is actually editable, so you can customize your inputs
* Native `<select>` dropdown menu, instead of hijacking the native `<select>` box
* Improved UI
* Works well with bootstrap, doesn't override anything or add unnecessary classes
