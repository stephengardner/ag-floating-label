# ag-floating-label

## A Material Design Inspired Floating Label Module for AngularJs Forms
####[Demo](https://github.com/stephengardner/ag-floating-label)

**Do you**:
* Love floating labels, and want an easy AngularJS directive?
* Feel like most floating label designs leave much to be desired?
* Like the Material Design input style, but don't feel like messing with an entire framework?

We've got you covered.

## Simplicity.
```javascript
<form>
    <ag-floating-label>
        <label>
            Name
        </label>
        <input type="text" ng-model="name" name="name"/>
    </ag-floating-label>
</form>
````
##Size.
Less than `50KB` for the `.js` and `.css` file, compared to Angular Material which is `700KB` minified and `1,500KB` unminified

## Design.

## Material-Design-Approved
Inspired by Google's Material Design and [Angular material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/input).
####Benefits:
* None of the extra Angular Material fluff/bloat
* **Bootstrap support**, doesn't override anything or add unnecessary classes
* Easily add `<input>` *hints* when an `<input>` is focused
* `Sass` that is actually editable, so you can easily customize your `<input>` elements
* Native `<select>` dropdown menu, instead of hijacking the native `<select>` box
* Improved UI
