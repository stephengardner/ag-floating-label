# ag-floating-label

## A Material Design Inspired Floating Label Module for AngularJs Forms
####[Demo](http://stephengardner.github.io/ag-floating-label/examples/)

If you...
* Love floating labels, and want an easy AngularJS directive
* Feel like most floating label designs leave much to be desired
* Or like the Material Design input style, but don't feel like messing with an entire framework

Then we've got you covered.

## Installation.
`bower install ag-floating-label`

## Simplicity.
```javascript
<form>
    <ag-floating-label>
        <label>
            Name
        </label>
        <input type="text" ng-model="name" name="name"/>
    </ag-floating-label>
</form>
````
##Size.
Less than `50KB` for the `.js` and `.css` file, compared to Angular Material which is `700KB` minified and `1,500KB` unminified

## Design.

## Flexibility.
We've included the `.scss` files, which make changing the format and colors a breeze.

## Material-Design Approved!
Inspired by Google's Material Design and [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/input).
####Benefits:
* None of the extra Angular Material fluff/bloat
* **Bootstrap support**, doesn't override anything or add unnecessary classes
* Easily add `<input>` *hints* when an `<input>` is focused
* `Sass` that is actually editable, so you can easily customize your `<input>` elements
* Native `<select>` dropdown menu, instead of hijacking the native `<select>` box
* Improved UI
